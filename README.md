  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    The goal of this project was to create a business intelligence dashboard for AdventureWorks, 
    a fictional cycling equipment company, using Power BI. The purpose of this project was to 
    demonstrate my ability to build insightful, accurate, and aesthetic reports in Power BI.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dataset was supplied by Maven Analytics during their Power BI Desktop for Business 
    Intelligence course and is also available from Microsoft.

    <li>Clothing had the highest return rate; the “Road - 750 Black, 48” bike showed an unusual 4.23% return rate, possibly due to defects.</li>

    <li>Revenue per customer has steadily declined despite increased customer count—possibly due to inflation, production constraints, or post-COVID effects.</li>
    <li>December consistently shows revenue spikes, averaging 158% increases over prior months, likely tied to holiday sales.</li>
